# Cloudflare

Now deploying blog to Cloudflare using Workers

Can deploy from `cli` with Wrangler:

```
npm run deploy:dev
npm run deploy:prod
```

Also integrated with Github so deploys can happen on push

Had some difficulties setting the correct `.env.*` file to use when on Cloudflare, used `dotenv` to explicitly pass it in, eg:

```
"build:dev": "dotenv -e .env.development -- astro build",
```
